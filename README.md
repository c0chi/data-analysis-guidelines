# Analyzing Data, the DataMade Way

You've [made the data](https://github.com/datamade/data-making-guidelines). Now
it's time to analyze it. Here, you'll find the principles that govern analysis
as well as the tools and organizational practices that make it possible at
DataMade.

## Principles

The basic principles of data analysis mirror [those that govern data-making](https://github.com/datamade/data-making-guidelines#basic-principles): Analysis should be reproducible with
one command, conducted using standard tools, and kept under version control.
