## Setting up your environment

There are few people who have no need of fiddling when writing analysis code
on the fly. If you aren't one of them, have no fear. The setup set forth in this
document optimizes your environment for interactive development, without having
build and rebuild your output document to check the axis labels on one chart.

### Install `pweave`

"Literate programming" is the process of bundling source code and documentation
into one package in service of legibility. By extension, "literate analysis"
combines analytical code with narrative text in service of legiblity, as well
as transparency and reproducibility.

In the "literate X" nomenclature, code is compiled by "tangling" the combined
source document, and documentation is generated by "weaving." [`pweave` is a
Python library](http://mpastell.com/pweave/) for "weaving" and "tangling" source
files containing text and Python code blocks.

Installation is as simple as:

```
$ pip install pweave
```

`pweave` can be used as both a Python module and a command-line utility. So far,
we've found the CLI to fit most seamlessly into our Make-driven data pipeline.

### Configure Atom

At DataMade, we all have our own preferences when it comes to code editors.
When it comes to analysis, Atom plays nicely with `pweave` to create an
interactive development environment that rivals [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) â€“
without the hassle of illegible diffs and highly customized file conversion
steps.

The bad news is that this environment still requires some configuration. The
good news is that one Denver data scientist [wrote an excellent guide](http://protips.maxmasnick.com/literate-python-setup-with-pweave-and-atom)
to that configuration.

A few amendments to the above walkthrough:

- Skip installing `expand-region`. Don't edit your `config.cson`, and don't add
`'cmd-shift-space': 'expand-region:expand'` to `keymap.cson`. We won't be
setting off code blocks in back ticks, and haven't found an alternative way to
configure `expand-region` to select code blocks in `noweb` syntax. Use
shift + up or shift + down to highlight your code block as necessary, then
shift + enter to run them.
- In the Hydrogen Kernel Mappings, specify `{'pweave markdown': 'Python 3'}`
rather than Python 2.

### Install LaTeX

- [GNU/Linux & Windows](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- [OS X](www.tug.org/mactex/)
